type: boolean
description: |
  If ``true``, allows the write operation to circumvent document level
  validation. This only applies when using the :pipeline:`$out` stage.

  an earlier version of MongoDB, this option will be ignored.

name: useCursor
type: boolean
description: |
  Indicates whether the command will request that the server provide
  results using a cursor. The default is ``true``.

  For MongoDB version 2.6 or later, ``useCursor`` allows users to turn
  off cursors if necessary to aid in mongod/mongos upgrades.

  ``useCursor`` is ignored for MongoDB versions prior to 2.6 as
  aggregation cursors are not available pre-2.6.
